Novel method of streaming directly from Kinect with Microsoft SDK & C++

## Goals

Another group in this class created a feature extractor for the Kinect using Processing and SimpleOpenNI. However, this method did not work for me. So, my goal was to find a workaround for people who don't want to use Processing, or are unable to like I was.
That was just the low level goal. The higher level goal was to create a feature extractor for the Kinect in order to specify which inputs are desired, to help with my accessibility project later on. By using my feature extractor, you can easily choose a simple set of inputs to use while ignoring unnecessary data. This will greatly simplify my next project, which will use gestures of the right and left hands to control a simulated car.
